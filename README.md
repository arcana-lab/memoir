# object-ir
A case for object representation in the LLVM IR

## Building
To build our noelle instance and the object-ir passes:
`cd compiler ; make`


To build the object-ir runtime:
`cd runtime ; make`

NOTE: this will not work unless you have already built the compiler.


To build the unit tests:
`cd tests/unit ; make`
